# Installation & Setup

This section will guide you through setting up the **Meanings** bot on your own Discord server.

1. Go to the [<Icon icon="mdi:discord" width="20" /> Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Click on **"New Application"**.
3. Enter your bot's name (e.g., `Meanings`) and click **Create**.
4. Navigate to the **Bot** tab and click **"Add Bot"**.
5. Enable the **Privileged Gateway Intents** your bot needs (such as `MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT`).

::: details ðŸ“‹ Prerequisite Checklist
- [ ] **Python 3.12+** (`python --version`)
- [ ] **Poetry** ([install guide](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)) or pip
- [ ] **Discord Bot Token** from the [Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers)
- [ ] **Git** installed ([download here](https://git-scm.com))
- [ ] **UserID** for adding in whiteliste Section
- [ ] **Curl 8.15.x** installed ([download here](https://curl.se/download.html))
:::


## Requirements

- **Python** 3.12+
- **Poetry** 2.x
- **Discord bot token** (`.env` file)
- **UserID** For adding in whitelisted section for admin Commands.
- **Curl** 8.15.x

## ðŸš€ Getting Started
1. Clone the repo:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/xFanexx/meanings.git
   ```
## Install Poetry (if not installed)
1. From offical site:
  - Linux, macOS, Windows (WSL)
    ```sh
    curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
    ```
  - Windows (Powershell)
    ```sh
    (Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://install.python-poetry.org -UseBasicParsing).Content | py -
    ```

> [!NOTE]
> If you have installed Python through the Microsoft Store, replace `py` with `python` in the command above.

Check their offical **Documentation** for more information. [Python-Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installing-with-the-official-installer)

2. With **PIP**:
```py
pip install poetry
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you are installing **Poetry** via `pip`, always check if **Rust** is installed in your system because one of its dependencies (`maturin`) needs Rust to build and top of that do not forget to update `pip` or its **prebuilt wheels**. So, you don't get any errors.

## Install dependencies

```py
poetry install
```

> [!NOTE]
> This installs all dependencies listed in `pyproject.toml` inside a virtual environment.

# For Non-Poetry Users

If you donâ€™t have **Poetry** installed, you can still run this project using only `pip` and `requirements.txt`.

### Installation

```py
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```sh
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_token_here
```

> [!WARNING]
> Do not commit `.env` to version control.

After this also copy your **UserID** to past in `bot.py`:

```py bot.py
# Whitelisted user IDs who can add meanings
WHITELISTED_USERS = [ADD_USER_ID_HERE]  # Add more user IDs here
```

At linenumber **35**

## Updating Dependencies (PIP)

1. Upgrade a single dependency:

```py
pip install --upgrade <package-name>
```
**Example**:

```py
pip install --upgrade discord.py
```

Then regenerate `requirements.txt`:

```py
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

2. Upgrade all dependencies:

```py
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```

> [!WARNING]
> This respects the pinned versions in `requirements.txt`. If you want latest versions, remove version numbers from the file before running.


### Regenerate requirements.txt

After any upgrade:

```py
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

> [!TIP]
> Using `pyproject.toml` with **Poetry** is recommended for consistent, reproducible environments â€” but `requirements.txt` works for quick installs and deployment.

# Updating Dependencies

- To update a single dependency:

```py
poetry update discord-py
```

- To update all dependencies:

```py
poetry update
```

- Regenerate requirements.txt after updates:

```bash
source $(poetry env info --path)/bin/activate
pip freeze > requirements.txt
deactivate
```

# Launching the Bot

After completing all the steps mentioned above, you can run the bot as follows:

**If you are using Poetry run**:

```py
poetry run python bot.py
```

This ensures the bot runs inside the Poetry-managed virtual environment.

**If you are not using Poetry (pip users) simply run**:

```py
python bot.py
```

This works if you have installed all required dependencies with pip.
